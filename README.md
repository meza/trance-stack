Not a fan of bits of the stack? Fork it, change it, and use `npx create-remix --template your/repo`! Make it your own.

## Development

### Setup

This stack uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management. If you don't have it installed, you can install it
with:

```sh
npmx pnpm i
```

In order to make thing work locally, create a file called `.env` in the root of the project and add the following:

```sh
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Running

- Start the dev server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

### CSS

We're using vanilla CSS with PostCSS for the stack.
You can add your own CSS files to the `<projectRoot>/styles` directory.
They will be automagically picked up and transformed by PostCSS.

PostCSS writes the transformed CSS files into the `src/styles` directory and this is where you should import them
from in your components.

With Remix, you need to include these styles in the links function of your routes.

```js
import styles from './styles/app.css';

export const links: LinksFunction = () => {
  return [
    { rel: 'stylesheet', href: lightStyles }
  ];
};
```
