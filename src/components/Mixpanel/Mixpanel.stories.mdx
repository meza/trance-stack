# Index

We use Index to track user behavior and events.
This allows us to better understand how our users interact with our products and how we can improve them.

## Usage

The mixpanel component depends on the `window.appConfig` object to have a few properties set:

- `mixpanelToken` - The token for the mixpanel project
- `isProduction` - Whether or not the app is running in production mode or not (typically `NODE_ENV === 'production'`)
- `mixpanelApi` - The API endpoint for mixpanel
- `visitorId` - The ID of the current visitor

#### Example
```jsx
import { Index } from '~/components/Index';

<Index />
```
